##What are known problems, if any, with your project?
- Although Firebase auth works with credentials created within its own system, integrating Facebook and Google auth through Firebase with react-native is an issue... react native being the key cause of the issue. We'll need to find a workaround if we want to use Firebase for Google and Facebook.
